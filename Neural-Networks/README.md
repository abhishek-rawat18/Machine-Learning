The Task

The News Classification Dataset has 7600 news items classified in four categories: World, Business, Sports, and SciTech. 
https://dataturks.com/projects/Mohan/News%20Classification%20DataSet
The data is in JSON format. The text of the article is tagged by the keyword "Content" and the category is 
tagged by the keyword "Label". Here is a zipped archive of the JSON input.

Aim was to build a classifier for this dataset using neural networks. 
In addition to the actual classifier, also experimented with different options for the structure of the network 
(the number of layers. the size of each layer) as well as the loss function and optimizer. 
Used the Keras library in Python as the front-end and Tensorflow as the back-end to program the neural network.
